Passive Haptic Learning
=======================

This repo contains files and resources for a replication of the "Passive
Haptic Learning" study documented in the following paper: 

Seim, C., Estes, T., & Starner, T. (2015). Towards Passive Haptic Learning of piano songs. IEEE World Haptics Conference, WHC 2015, 445â€“450. http://doi.org/10.1109/WHC.2015.7177752

This replication was created in November 2016 by John Sullivan. 

## Hardware: 

- Prototype gloves were built using the haptic boards developed at IDMIL for the ilinx and Body:Suit:Score projects
- The boards were reconfigured for xBee wireless communication.
- A standard MIDI keyboard is used, connected to the host computer via USB.

## Software:

- The PHL application is built with Max by Cycling '74. 
- It uses the bach library for advanced MIDI functionality. 
- There may be other externals - check the Max console for additional dependencies. 

-----

## General Notes: 

- The full experiment was never run, and at last step there were some software bugs that need to get worked out. 
- The gloves are currently intact, though the xBee boards are no longer configured, having been acquisitioned for other projects.
